# sf-giants-stub-hub

My attempt at making a SF Giants playoff tickets scanner.

I could not find a well documented golang StubHub API module so I just implemented what I needed. StubHub API is bizarre as the entry level developer accounts are throttled / rate limited in a way such that you need to upgrade your account tier to make any kind of ticket scanner. This makes sense as to thwart bad actors etc.
